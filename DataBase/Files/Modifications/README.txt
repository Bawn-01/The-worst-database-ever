Python and javascript files go in this folder.
For explanation: Python is for input, and javascript is for managing files but so is python.


When you have added your file(s) proceed to the Database.bat file and if its python:
python FILENAME.py 

Or Javascript:
node FILENAME.js


The order that you place these commands change the way the files are executed.
